Soo... this is how the game engine should work.

First you distribute all the cards and it's the turn of player 1

0. if any player has a tanela, he should show it.


1. player1 gets a choice of taking the top card or choosing another.

2. player1 should first choose to throw a card.

3. then player1 can either choose the top card or the one below it.

4. player2 first throws a card

5. player2 can either choose the card player1 threw or choose one from the deck

6. player3 first throws a card

7. player3 can either choose the card player2 threw or choose one from the deck

... this goes on until....

8. if playerX has three sequences, he shows them and then draws the joker. After viewing the joker, playerX can use the joker in between sequences.

10. if playerY also gets three sequences, he shows them and can see the joker.

....this goes on until....

11. one player gets all the sequences right. then he shows his cards. and then the points are calculated afterwards.
